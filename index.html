<B><BR><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="6"><P>With the ability to not only create Electricity and but also store it, the Gymerator can be an addition to creating electricity and helping needs of society. Also as more people start using it to produce electricity, it will result in the betterment of the fitness of the society. And as more people join in, there will be more profit making India a richer and fitter country.</p></font></b>




<BR><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="4"><p>Since product is new in concept and Gyms and fitness centers are major customers. 
Though it is beneficial for fitness at home also but we have planned to focus on Gyms and fitness centers on priority. There are around 2000 gyms in NCR including Delhi. 
Each Fitness center has 3 to 10 treadmills, which comes out to around 10000 treadmills so there is huge scope for product in Gyms itself. 
We have planned to contact above Gyms and fitness centers by social media, webpages, advertisements on TVs and devices, and visiting personally and convincing benefits to them by installing demo product.  
Also people would also be buying our product for the free generated electricity ( especially people who use treadmills regularly and have them in their homes) and hence increase.</p>

<P><font face="Roboto" size="4" color="black">85% of electric power is generated through thermal power based generation plants. Which uses coal as fuel India has remaining coal reserve is for next 25 years only, which is very serious concern. Coal causes pollution.
 If we can use gymerator produced energy as a replacement, conservation of fossil fuel energy and decreased AIR pollution rate in India would occur simultaneously.
 Hence, as a result of our newly electricity based concept, we are able to kill two birds with one stone. And also the machine itself would cause no pollution.
With the correct equipment and good connectivity of wires, concerns regarding children touching can be discarded. </font></P>
